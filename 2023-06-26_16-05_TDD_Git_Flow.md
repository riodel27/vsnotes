# TDD Git Flow

1. ## Create a new branch

Start by creating a new branch for your feature. For example, you can create a branch called `feature/sync-auctions-button`.

2. ## Write failing tests

Switch to the feature branch and write the initial failing tests for the Sync Auctions Button feature.

3. ## Commit failing tests

Commit the failing tests to the feature branch. This ensures that the tests are saved and can be revisited later.

4. ## Run the tests

Execute the test suite and confirm that the newly added tests are failing, as expected.

5. ## Implement minimum code

Begin implementing the minimum code necessary to make the failing tests pass. Keep the implementation simple, focusing on making the tests pass one step at a time.

6. ## Commit code changes

Once you have implemented the code to make the tests pass, commit your changes to the feature branch.

7. ## Write additional failing tests

Write additional tests to cover new scenarios or edge cases related to the Sync Auctions Button feature. These tests should fail initially because the corresponding functionality is not yet implemented.

8. ## Run the tests

Execute the test suite again and ensure that the newly added tests are failing, as expected.

9. ## Implement code changes

Implement the necessary code changes to make the new tests pass. Follow the TDD approach by focusing on making one test pass at a time.

10. ## Commit code changes

Commit the code changes to the feature branch after each step, ensuring that the commit messages clearly indicate the purpose of the changes made.

11. ## Repeat steps 7-10

Continue writing additional tests and implementing the corresponding code changes in an iterative manner until you have fully implemented the Sync Auctions Button feature.

12. ## Review and refactor

Once all tests pass and the feature is fully implemented, review your code and tests for clarity, readability, and adherence to best practices. Refactor your code if necessary to improve its quality.

13. ## Merge into main branch

Finally, merge the feature branch into the main branch (e.g., master or main) to incorporate the Sync Auctions Button feature into the main codebase.

Following this Git flow allows you to track the progression of your TDD implementation, keep the main branch stable, and collaborate with other developers effectively. Each commit represents a step in the TDD process, and the tests act as a safety net, ensuring the correctness of your code as you make changes and additions to the feature.
